Problem
A positive integer 
 
X is called lucky if it has an even power of 
2
2 in its prime factorization. More formally, let 
 
p be the largest integer such that 
 
X is divisible by 
2
 
2 
p
 . Then 
 
X is a lucky number if and only if 
 
p is divisible by 
2
2.

You are given a positive integer 
 
N. Find if it is a lucky number.

Input Format
The first line of the input contains a single integer 
 
T - the number of test cases. The description of 
 
T test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer 
 
N.

Output Format
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer. That integer should be 
1
1 if 
 
N is a lucky number and 
0
0 otherwise.

1.

Example case 2: Number 
 
=
2
N=2 has 
2
2 to the power of 
1
1 in its prime factorization. Therefore, it is not lucky and the answer is 
0
0.

Example case 3: Number 
 
=
3
N=3 has 
2

1.

Example case 5: Number 
 
=
8
N=8 has 
2
2 to the power of 
3
3 in its prime factorization. Therefore, it is not lucky and the answer is 
0
0.

Example case 6: Number 
 
=
48
N=48 has 
2
2 to the power of 
4
